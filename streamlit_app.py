Dont worry! We'll explore the steps/usage in a simplified manner.

**ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Think of 'ReLU' as the robot's way of getting excited when it sees something interesting in a picture. It's like when you get really happy when you see your favorite toy. Our robot's 'ReLU' move makes it light up with excitement and focus on the exciting parts of the picture.

**Dropout**: Sometimes, our robot wants to be really careful. It's like when you're crossing a tricky bridge, and you take tiny steps to make sure you don't fall. Our robot does something similar with a move called 'dropout.' When it's not very sure about the picture, it uses 'dropout' to slow down and think more. This helps it avoid making mistakes. So, 'dropout' is like our robot's safety move.

**Softmax**: When our robot is confident and ready to tell us what's in the picture, it uses 'softmax.' It's like when you're sure about the answer to a question and raise your hand in class. Our robot speaks up and confidently says, 'I think it's 8!' or 'I think it's 7!' It doesn't guess â€“ it uses 'softmax' to make a smart and confident decision.

**Forward**: To make all of this happen, our robot has a special step called 'forward.' It's like a magic spell that combines 'dropout' and 'softmax' with its thinking and seeing abilities. When the robot looks at the picture, it thinks about it, uses 'dropout' to be careful, and then speaks up with 'softmax' to tell us what it sees. 'Forward' is like the robot's secret recipe for playing the picture game.

With these three moves, our robot becomes a handwriting detection champion. It's cautious when it needs to be and confident when it knows the answer, all thanks to 'dropout,' 'softmax,' and 'forward'!"''')
