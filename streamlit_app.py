**Did you know?**

Why do we see random_state="42" a lot? 
It is actually a reference from the movie "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". It soon became a programming convention that caught on.

In the movie, when a supercomputer is asked the answer to â€œthe Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything." It thinks for a 
really long time, and responds with "42"

To do this, we need to make the pictures a special shape so the computer can understand them. It's like putting the pictures in a magic box.

Each picture is like a tiny puzzle made up of squares (pixels). Our magic box needs to know how many squares are in each picture, and we also have to tell it how many pictures we're going to show. For the pictures we're using today, they're all in black and white, like drawings. So, we say there's just one color channel (because it's only black and white), and each picture is 28 squares high and 28 squares wide.''')
